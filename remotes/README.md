**Remotes known to be partly working**

RFT-Auto-N (04-00161) and RFT-N (04-00160) currently only work in legacy (uni-directional) mode

Since [2.9.0-beta1](https://github.com/arjenhiemstra/ithowifi/releases/tag/Version-2.9.0-beta1)
Bi-Directional join and communication is supported (partially). There might still be a error indication but most functionality should work for the RFT-Auto-N (04-00161), RFT-N (04-00160) and Itho Spider (03-00476) 

**Remotes known to be not working**

536-0106, seems like it uses a different (older) version of the protocol.
